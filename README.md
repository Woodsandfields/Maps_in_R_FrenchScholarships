[The maps produced are here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Woodsandfields/R_FrenchScholarships/master/myMap__choropleth.png) and [here.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Woodsandfields/R_FrenchScholarships/master/myMap__classic.png). These links will open the two maps from this repository (myMap_chropleth.png and myMap_classic.png) with the broadest view frame for better viewing.


[The final document is R_FrenchScholarships.md in this repo](https://github.com/Woodsandfields/R_FrenchScholarships/blob/master/FrenchScholarships.md
). I am still working on it to add to it and improve some aspects, especially try different map solutions. However, the original dataset I started with is quite limited and doesn't allow for meaningful analysis.

NB: This is originally a practice exercise made around a course on investigating data in R for journalists with the Knight Foundation: I chose a dataset on the web and ran an analysis with the objective of producing maps.
