This is a practice exercise made around a course on investigating data in R for journalists with the Knight Foundation : I chose a dataset and ran an analysis in order to produce a plot and maps.

[The maps produced are here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Woodsandfields/R_FrenchScholarships/master/myMap__choropleth.png) and [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Woodsandfields/R_FrenchScholarships/master/myMap__classic.png) 


[The final document is R_FrenchScholarships.md in this repo](https://github.com/Woodsandfields/R_FrenchScholarships/blob/master/FrenchScholarships.md
). I am still working on it to add to it and improve some aspects of it. However, the original dataset I started with is quite limited and doesn't allow for extensive, meaningful analysis.
